    # 3. Restores dependencies for all projects in the solution
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore ./ProjektLabor.sln

    # 4. Builds the entire solution in Release configuration
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build ./ProjektLabor.sln --no-restore --configuration Release

    # 5. Runs all tests found in the solution
